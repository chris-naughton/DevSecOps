- Targets for mean time to production should be set up while also mitigating risks, 
such as insider threats, through the use of “merge requests” and multiple

- Automation modules for specific compliance: HIPPA, PCI-DSS, SOC

- Authentication and validation in code and build repositories
- Logging all activities associated with code and build updates
- Sending build reports to developers and stopping everything if a build fails
- Sending build reports to security and stopping everything if the audit or validation fails
