### SSH KEYS ###  
This is where the ssh key lives
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/.ssh]
└─$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ansible"           
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/kali/.ssh/id_ed25519): /home/kali/.ssh/ansible

It has been copied over to ubun1 and verified that it is in the authorized_keys

### INVENTORY FILE ### 
- create an inventory file that contains all of the IP addresses for the machine I want to manage with
ansible
- adding FQDN over IP addresses is a better idea as IP addresses can change
- verify that everything is working with: 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/shields-up/DevSecOps/ansible]
└─$ ansible all -u ubun1 --key-file ~/.ssh/ansible -i inventory -m ping       
10.0.2.15 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

all == run against all instances 
--key-file == keyfile I am passing 
-i == include inventory file 
-m == module that I want to run note this is not an ICMP "ping"

### ANSIBLE CONFIG FILE ### 
- note the ansible.cfg in teh working dir takes priority over the one in /etc/ansible 

I have added an ansible.cfg file to the working dir and specified: 
- inventory file 
- priv key 
- remote user 

This allows me to shorten the ping module command to: 
                                                                                                                                                                            
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/shields-up/DevSecOps/ansible]
└─$ ansible all -m ping                                                       
10.0.2.15 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

### ISSUE ELEVATED PRIV COMMANDS ###
This allows commands to be run with sudo 

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/shields-up/DevSecOps/ansible]
└─$ ansible all -m apt -a update_cache=true --become --ask-become-pass                                                                  2 ⨯
BECOME password: 
10.0.2.15 | CHANGED => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "cache_update_time": 1630257636,
    "cache_updated": true,
    "changed": true
}

-m == module 
-a == argument 
--become == allows you to elevate privs (defaults to sudo)
--ask-become-pass == the password for the sudo user on the box
