I am using this YAML to test the different modes: 

apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: istio-system # this is the namespace that it will be applied to
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: DISABLE # mode setting

Apply with: 
k apply -f peerauth.yaml

> root@devsecops-cloud:~$ k apply -f peerauth.yaml 
peerauthentication.security.istio.io/istio-system created

root@devsecops-cloud:~$ k get pa
NAME           MODE      AGE 
istio-system   DISABLE   2m2s
