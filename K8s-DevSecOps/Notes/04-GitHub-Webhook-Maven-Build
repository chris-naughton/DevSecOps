1. added a GitHub WebHook via gits web UI and set it to my jenkins URL
ending the url with /github-webhook/
- Content type is application/json
- Call to jenkins occurs when a push is made to the repo

2. Create a new pipeline called "devsecops-numeric-application"
- check the GitHub hook trigger
- add a pipeline build step for pipeline script from scm
-- select Git and add repo URL
- save the changes

3. Build using the Jenkinsfile:

pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
      stage('Build Artifact') {
            steps {
              sh "mvn clean package -DskipTests=true"
              archive 'target/*.jar' //so that they can be downloaded later
            }
        }   
    }
}
