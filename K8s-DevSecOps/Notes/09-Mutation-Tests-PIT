Mutation tests run unit tests against modified versions of application code 
If the code changes the unit tests should fail 
If the code changes and the unit tests do not fail then there is a problem
The goal is to have a high number of mutations that are "killed"

To test this I have updated the applications pom.xml to include the pitest-maven plugin
I have also updated the NumericApplicationTests.java file and modified the Jenkinsfile to 
include the build step
