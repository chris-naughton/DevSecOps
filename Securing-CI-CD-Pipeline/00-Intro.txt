Terms: 
CI/CD: Continiuos Integration / Devployment or Delivery

SAST: Static Application Security Testing - White Box
- analyze source code early in the SDLC
- establish coding practices and guidelines

DAST: Dynamic Applicatoin Security Testing - Black Box
- analyze and find vulns/threats in a running web applicatoin based on request/response model. 

IAST: Interactive Application Security Testing 
- This is used to address shortcomings of SAST or DAST
- This places an agent within the application to perform real-time analysis

RASP: Run-time Application Secutity Protecting
- More of a Security tool not so much a testing tool. 
- Plugged into the application to run constant checks. 
- Can respond by terminiating attacker sessions and alert defneders.

Phased Approach to DevSecOps: 

- Security Training for engineering 
- Regular code analysis within the CI/CD pipeline
- Regular compliance monitoring 
- Include SAST, DAST phases within the pipeline 
- Define criteria for security phases to pass/fail
- Security tickets must be included as issues in a sprint
