- Start at manage jenkins 
- Go to Manage nodes
- There will be a default main agent present
- Click on New Node. Give it a name and select perm. 
- Fill out the next form 
-- for the Remote root directory create a new directory on the applicaiton server. 
-- in my case "/home/app/jenkins_workspace" 
- Go into the jenkins_workspace directory and create an agent directory
- In order to get the agent configured and connected I had to do the following: 
-- name: app
-- remote root dir: /home/app/jenkins
-- lable: linux
-- Usage: as much as possible
-- launch method: connecting to main
-- custom workdir path: /home/app/jenkins
-- use WebSocket: on
-- GLOBAL SECURITY SETTINGS
--- TCP port for agents set to random
-- AFTER AGENT WAS SAVED
--- download agent jar from details page
--- from working machine scp agent to the app servers /tmp directory
--- moved agent.jar to the /home/app/jenkins
--- chmod +x on agent.jar
--- run the following from app@app:~/jenkins_workspace$:  java -jar agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://192.168.0.13:8080/computer/app/jenkins-agent.jnlp -secret <secret here> -workDir "/home/app/jenkins_workspace"
--- the above commnad has been made into a shell script "start.sh"
