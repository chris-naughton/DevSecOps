- cloned this to the jenkins server 
https://github.com/trainmefordevsecops/ANCHORE-SECURITY.git
- verify that it is up and running after compose up 
http://192.168.0.13:8228/

- Add the ANCHORE plugin to jenkins
- Go to global config settings and setup ANCHORE
- http://192.168.0.13:8228/v1 is the endpoint it needs
- set admin login

- Create a freestyle job 
- This is running with the master node 
- supply github url for project 
- keep ANCHORE build step setting at default
- add a shell build step to feed it the image

This never worked
