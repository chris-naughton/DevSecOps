- I have created a synk account
- Configured synk to scan one of my git projects
-- https://app.snyk.io/org/<username>

synk token 83407780-53d9-4b80-9cd9-d48f8443d2e0

- I have installed synk to the app server via npm 
- commands to auth
-- snyk test
-- snyk auth

On the Jenkins server I am creating a new security job
- install snyk security plugin
- create a freestyle project
- I added a build step with the following
cd ${WORKSPACE}
echo "snyk test && snyk monitor" > snyk.sh
chmod +x snyk.sh
/bin/bash snyk.sh || true
snyk test --json | sunk-to-html -o results.html

- I installed the html-publisher plugin
- I then added a post build step to publish html reports

lastly I added my git repo url to the job and ran it
